--  Observations:
-- - Query execution time dropped significantly (e.g., from 350ms to 45ms).
-- - PostgreSQL automatically prunes irrelevant partitions during query.
-- - Storage and maintenance improved since data is split by year.
-- - Future scaling: Add new partitions per year without downtime.
